Stage 1: Data Collection
- Anonymous salary submissions (First Nations women + others for comparison)
- Currently: 80,000+ salary data points
- Industry benchmarks (ABS, Seek, Glassdoor, government)

Stage 2: Statistical Analysis (Intersectional)
For each role:
  - Calculate median salary by:

    * Experience (years)
    * Education (degree, certificate)
    * Region (Sydney vs. rural variations)
    * Company size
    * Industry
    
Example:
Role: Project Manager, Sydney, 8+ years, Bachelor's

  - First Nations women: AU$108,000 median (n=45)
  - **Gap vs. all women: AU$17,000 (-13.6%)**
  - **Note: This is the intersectional (gender + race) gap First Nations women face**

Stage 3: Negotiation Coaching
- User inputs their offer (salary, benefits, equity, flexibility)
- Algorithm compares to market data (intersectional analysis)
- Generates negotiation strategy:
  * "You're 12% below market - ask for AU$20k more"
  * "Industry average for First Nations women in your experience: AU$120k"
  * "Negotiation script: 'I researched this role and...'"
  * "Likely counter-offer: AU$115k (plan for this)"
  * "Alternative benefits if salary inflexible (flexible hours, work-from-home)"
  
Stage 4: Outcome Tracking

- Update community benchmarks (anonymized)
```

**Safety Features:**
